# React Mongo Front

This project is a React-based frontend for interacting with the FastAPI backend that manages products. It includes components for listing products, performing a health check, and displaying a home page.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-frontend-repo.git
   cd your-frontend-repo
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the React application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Project Structure

- **App.js:** The main entry point of the React application. It defines the routes using `react-router-dom`.

- **components/Home.js:** Displays a list of products on the home page.

- **components/ListProducts.js:** Displays a list of products fetched from the backend.

- **components/HealthCheck.js:** Performs a health check on the backend to ensure it is running.

- **api.js:** Contains functions for making API requests to the FastAPI backend.

## Available Routes

- **Home:** `/` - Displays a list of products on the home page.

- **List Products:** `/products` - Displays a list of products fetched from the backend.

- **Health Check:** `/health` - Performs a health check on the backend.

## Configuration

- Ensure that the backend API URL is correctly set in the `api.js` file.

```javascript
// Update the backend URL if needed
const API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000';
```

## Additional Notes

- This README provides basic usage instructions. For advanced features or customization, refer to the source code and relevant component files.

- Customize the Nginx configuration (`nginx.conf`) based on your deployment requirements.

- For production deployment, consider optimizing the React application and configuring a proper server setup.

```

Make sure to replace placeholders such as `your-username`, `your-frontend-repo`, and `http://localhost:8000` with your actual GitHub username, frontend repository name, and the correct backend API URL. Additionally, update the content as needed based on any additional features or customization in your React application.
